Todo Full-Stack Web Application — Phase III: AI Chatbot

Target audience: End users of the Todo app who want to manage tasks via natural language.
Focus: AI-powered conversational interface for task management using MCP tools.

Success criteria:
- AI agent correctly interprets natural language commands and maps to MCP tool calls
- Chat maintains conversation context across requests and sessions
- All CRUD operations (add, list, update, complete, delete) are auditable and confirmable
- Errors handled gracefully with human-friendly responses
- Frontend is dark-mode, responsive, mobile-first, and user-friendly
- All requests authenticated; user isolation enforced
- Stateless backend architecture strictly enforced
- AI assistant confirms every action performed via MCP tools

Constraints:
- Frontend: OpenAI ChatKit UI integrated with FastAPI backend
- Backend: Python FastAPI with OpenAI Agents SDK and MCP server
- MCP tools: add_task, list_tasks, complete_task, delete_task, update_task
- Database: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL (Task, Conversation, Message models)
- Authentication: Better Auth with JWT tokens
- Stateless backend (no in-memory conversation state)
- Chat endpoint: POST /api/{user_id}/chat
- All AI tool calls must persist data to database
- No features outside of Phase III scope

Not building:
- Full AI assistant unrelated to todo tasks
- Non-task-related AI conversation
- Manual coding outside the agentic workflow
- Non-stateless backend logic
- Alternative authentication methods
